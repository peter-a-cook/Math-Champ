# Math-Champ

Math facts are the addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers 1 to 9. In general, addition is learned in 1st grade, subtraction in 2nd grade, multiplication in 3rd grade, and division in 4th grade. These facts build on one another. The Math Champ application is an opportunity for children to learn the facts visually and with hands-on interaction. The app is designed as a 60-second competition with other students. Children can also compete with themselves or even parents/teachers. This is a great app for teachers to use in the classroom to spark some fun and friendly competition as well as prepare students for middle school math competitions like those encountered in MATHCOUNTS and similar clubs/programs. A standout feature of this app is the ability to change number pad colors, making the app visually appealing to children. The number pad color choices are green, rainbow, bee, checker, and random. Future app updates will include even more color choices. Math Champ can also be used by older students and adults to keep their mind sharp.
